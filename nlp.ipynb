    "NLP Trend Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "Conduct a thorough Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis of the student check-in data. Primary goal is to transform the unstructured text in the \"Win\", \"Loss\", and \"Blocker\" columns into quantifiable, actionable insights. By identifying and quantifying the most frequent topics and sentiment trends uncover the core experiences of the student cohort. This analysis will directly inform program management about what is working well and where immediate improvements are needed.\n",

    "1. Code Repository: A dedicated Git repository containing a self-contained Jupyter Notebook or Python script\n",

    "2. Top Trends Summary: A concise report, summarizing the:\n",
    "- Top 5 most frequent Wins themes\n",
    "- Top 5 most frequent Losses themes\n",
    "- Top 5 most frequent Blockers themes\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Visual Dashboard: Data visualisations that illustrate the frequency and distribution of the identified themes.\n",

    "4. Recommendations: A concluding section that provides 3-5 concrete recommendations for the program team based on your findings.\n"
